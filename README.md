## Summary

This game of Tic Tac Toe allows users to select between two modes - 2 player, and vs. computer, and interact with a gameboard using click events. 

With 2 player mode, the users input their names which are then displayed above the game board until there is a winner or draw.

Computer mode pits the human player against an unbeatable AI that chooses the best possible next move using the minimax algorithm and recursion. 

This project was made as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full stack javascript curriculum.

## Key learning points

- Factory Functions to create objects
- The Module Pattern and IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
